# Biography
I am a 5th year doctoral student in the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Arizona, originally hailing from beautiful, sunny Southern California (Orange County). As a member of the [Funk Lab](http://uacc.arizona.edu/profile/janet-funk) I investigate curcuminoids, which are the primary bioactive ingredients from the turmeric rhizome, and breast cancer bone metastasis. Metastatic breast cancer is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with breast cancer, which has a predilection for metastasizing to bone where it destroys bone (osteolysis). Specifically, I assess curcumin's inhibitory mechanism of action against osteolytic breast cancer bone metastases and the role tissue-specific metabolism in curcuminoid bioactivation.

I have always been curious about science and how/why things worked in general. Originally wanting to make prosthetics using biomimetic principles, I pursued my B.S. in Bioengineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (GO BRUINS!). During this time, I lived an unhealthy lifestyle, gained a bunch of weight, lost a bunch of weight, and realized the important role diet played in health. This inspired me to get my M.S. in Nutritional Sciences at California State University, Long Beach, during which I also received my credential as a Registered Dietitian through a distance program at Oakwood University. It was during this time I learned about the role diet can have in cancer risk and gained an interest in using dietary bioactive compounds as adjuvant treatments for diseases, such as cancer.

When I am not in the lab I enjoy reading (mostly science fiction), swimming, brewing and drinking beer, building computers, tinkering, and watching all the local wild life ([Gambel's Quails](https://www.nps.gov/sagu/learn/nature/gambels-quail.htm) are my favorite).
